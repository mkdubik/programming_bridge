	Program is structured into 3 parts:
		a) gui.py - All gui related functions and builds are implemented here
		b) power_method.py - Everything related only to the power iteration calculation
			is implemented in here
		c) dialog.py - Helper class to present results in a better fashion

		gui.py is the main entry point to the application which fires the GUI but it is possible to run power_method.py without gui to and have command line output

2.
	Source code is reasonably commented with data invariants.
	Variables are named with obvious purpose.
